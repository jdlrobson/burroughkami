# Introduction

The [cut up method/technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique) is a literary technique to form new works of art.
It was popularised by [William S. Burroughs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs).

It's like origami - give it some texts you have written and twist them and shape them into new things so that you can tease
out things in your subconcious or create something totally new.

Hence the name.
